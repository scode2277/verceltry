To effectively address this without compromising on rapid development and deployment, it is essential to integrate security into the process, which is where devsecops comes into play. By implementing devsecops, projects can not only deploy faster, but also be more secure. When operating in a devsecops mindset, projects prioritizes automation and collaboration between the development, operations and security teams. Some of the key areas to consider are: 1. Integrate security measures early in the development process, such as by utilizing security tools such as fuzzing, static and dynamic analysis tools in your CI/CD process, to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities before they turn into critical issues. 2.

Commit hash: Agree on a specific commit hash from the repository and freeze the previously defined scope. Avoid continuous modifications to the codebase. Any changes should be communicated, and the commit hash should be updated for the code under review. 3. Documentation and specification: - Documentation describes how the code works, how to use it, and its expected functionality. - Specification defines the exact requirements, constraints, and behaviors the system must meet, including invariants that must always hold true. - Invariants are the properties of the system that should always hold. Invariants can be useful for checking the expected behavior of the system when the certain actions or a transaction flow is executed. Invariants are useful in many testing approaches, including manual reviews, where a reviewer checks whether a specific property can be violated for a function under any sequence of function calls. - Get simplified math formulas if the protocol has any custom/fancy formulas implemented. 4. Tests: Tests are important for understanding the expected behavior and ensuring that the system works as intended. The following types of tests can be useful for understanding and verifying the code: - unit tests : Unit tests ensure that individual functions behave correctly under expected conditions. - Integration Tests : Integration tests verify that your smart contracts work correctly with real external systems.","url":"/pages/external-security-reviews/smart-contracts/manual-review#gather-resources"},{"title":"Manual Review › Smart contract higher overview","content":"Documentation and whitepaper walkthrough: Go through the whitepaper and documentation to gain a better understanding of the project and to see how the proposed business logic is structured.

Test cases are important. They give you an understanding of how the setup works and what state needs to be in place for users to start using the system’s entry points. They also give you time to test more offensive or edge-case scenarios (after verifying unit tests) instead of spending most of your time testing general scenarios. - When math formulas or complex interconnected calls are involved, debugging the values of variables helps sometime to see how the state changes are happening e.g. what is the value of variable x/totalStakedEth before the specific internal/external call. or what it becomes after that call. - Debugging can be done in many ways, depending on which framework you are using. Some examples are. - Foundry - native debugger, console logs in the contracts, Tenderly debugger, simbolik. - Hardhat - console logs in the contracts, debuggers like Hardhat-tracer, Tenderly debugger. 2. Choose least dependent contract to review one by one: This can be done by looking into a diagram and current understanding of the smart contract functionality. For example in this case it's a Token contract that is least dependent (in fact the functionality from that contract is getting used in other contracts so other smart contracts are dependent on it). 3. Checklist reviews: - Known smart contract vulnerabilities checklist. - Project specific checklists (e.g. When dealing with bridges it's also important to check bridge specific checklists). - Checklists may vary over time and can become outdated. Below are some examples for reference: - Smart Contract Security Field Guide - Smart Contract Security Verification Standard 4. Maintain a list of invariants: Maintain a list of invariants for every functions (Can be useful later for other tests/fuzzing/format verification). 5. Offensively analyze the code: Offensively analyze the code to identify logical issues, edge cases, and any conditions that could break invariants. 6. Visit all paths: Visiting all paths in a smart contract is crucial from a security perspective. For example, in the below withdraw() function, every path has its own potential security implications and behavior that needs to be verified. Sometimes these unexpected paths lead us to potential bugs. Generally frameworks provide tools to check test coverage, like the forge coverage command which can be used to generate code coverage reports for tests. &gt; While this section focuses more on manual approach, automated testing approaches like fuzzing and formal verification can be useful here for checking possible invariant violations across multiple paths. As can be seen below, everything boils down to each path. Even the ternary expression is ultimately a path.

Run all the tests: Run all available tests on the updated code to ensure the newly updated code does not break any invariant. 4. Write new tests for the updated code: If the updated code creates any new control flow paths it's necessary to write tests to visit those paths and to ensure it yields the expected output. 5. Go through checklists again: For the updated functionality (depending on what has been changed), review the checklists to ensure that no vulnerabilities remain or have been introduced. 6. Check things/notes that needs to be revisited: Check items or notes that need to be revisited from the manual review. Sometimes you may have observations noted, e.g., Adding this fix to the code can create this problem. 7. Update the report: Update the report and issue status based on the updated code. - Change the status. - Add/update most recently reviewed commit link/hash. - Add comments from the audit team (when required). - These may include, for example, the reason why an issue remains open, any unresolved security concerns, or even new issues created by the fixes, but are not limited to these. - Add comments from the project team (when required). - These may include the reasons why an issue is acknowledged, or mitigations that will not be implemented at the smart contract level, but are not limited to these.","url":"/pages/external-security-reviews/smart-contracts/manual-review#updated-code-review"},{"title":"Manual Review › Final thoughts","content":"Having multiple teams/members review each contract individually leads to better results, as it ensures more sets of eyes are examining the code.","url":"/pages/external-security-reviews/smart-contracts/manual-review#final-thoughts"},{"title":"Manual Review › References","content":"Auditing mental model by Caliber ---","url":"/pages/external-security-reviews/smart-contracts/manual-review#references"},{"title":"Preparation › Introduction","content":"import { TagList, AttributionList, TagProvider, TagFilter, ContributeFooter } from '../../../../components' # Preparation A common misconception is that when doing a security review, you can just hand off the written code and let reviewers do their work.

Think of it as a digital signature that proves the DNS response came from the legitimate source. How it protects you : Without DNSSEC, attackers can intercept DNS queries and return fake IP addresses, redirecting users to malicious sites that look identical to yours. DNSSEC prevents this by cryptographically signing all DNS responses. Setup process : 1. Enable DNSSEC signing at your DNS provider (most providers have this as a simple toggle) 2. Publish DS records to your registrar (your DNS provider will give you these records) 3. Monitor DNSSEC validation status regularly using online tools 4.

How it protects you : Without CAA records, any Certificate Authority can issue SSL certificates for your domain. Attackers could potentially obtain fake certificates and use them in sophisticated phishing attacks that appear to have valid SSL encryption. Before setting CAA records, identify which CA issued your current certificate: - Command line : openssl s_client -connect yourdomain.com:443 -servername yourdomain.com | openssl x509 -noout -issuer - Web tools : SSL Labs Server Test provides comprehensive certificate analysis including issuer information - Browser : Click the padlock icon → Certificate details → Issuer information Setup process : Add CAA records to your DNS zone.

Email Security Configuration","content":"Email security records protect against email spoofing and phishing attacks. When your domain is compromised, attackers often change email settings to intercept password reset emails and other sensitive communications. #### SPF (Sender Policy Framework) SPF records specify which mail servers are authorized to send emails on behalf of your domain. This prevents attackers from spoofing your domain in phishing emails. How it protects you : Without SPF, anyone can send emails claiming to be from your domain. Attackers use this for sophisticated phishing campaigns that appear to come from your legitimate email address. This is particularly dangerous as attackers can impersonate executives or team members to target your own organization and users - imagine receiving a &quot;urgent wire transfer&quot; request from your CFO's email address, or your users getting a &quot;mandatory wallet update&quot; from your official support email. Setup : Add an SPF record to your DNS zone: #### DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) DKIM adds a digital signature to your emails, allowing receiving servers to verify that emails actually came from your domain and haven't been tampered with. How it protects you : DKIM signatures prove email authenticity and integrity, making it much harder for attackers to successfully spoof your domain in phishing campaigns. Setup : Configure with your email provider and publish public keys in DNS (your email provider will provide the specific records). #### MTA-STS (Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security) MTA-STS enforces encrypted connections between mail servers, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks on email transmission. How it protects you : Without MTA-STS, emails can be intercepted in transit. This is especially critical for password reset emails and other sensitive communications. Setup : Add an MTA-STS record to your DNS zone: #### DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication) DMARC builds on SPF and DKIM to provide policy enforcement for email authentication. It tells receiving mail servers what to do with emails that fail authentication checks. How it protects you : DMARC prevents email spoofing by instructing receiving servers to reject or quarantine emails that fail authentication, protecting your users from phishing attacks. Setup : Add a DMARC record to your DNS zone:","url":"/pages/infrastructure/dns-and-domain-registration#3-email-security-configuration"},{"title":"DNS and Domain Registration Security › 1. Choosing a Secure Registrar","content":"Your domain registrar is the company that manages your domain registration with the central registry. This is often the weakest link in domain security, as many registrars have poor security practices and are vulnerable to social engineering attacks. #### Enterprise-Grade Registrars (Recommended) These registrars are designed for high-value domains and have security measures that consumer registrars lack: - MarkMonitor : Used by Fortune 500 companies, requires legal documentation for changes, dedicated security team - AWS Route53 : IAM policy integration, CloudTrail logging, uses Amazon Registrar for major TLDs (but check TLD support) - Cloudflare Registrar : No markup pricing, automatic DNSSEC, built-in DDoS protection, requires Cloudflare services #### Consumer Registrars to Avoid for Critical Domains These registrars are designed for personal use and lack the security measures needed for Web3 projects: - GoDaddy : History of social engineering vulnerabilities, call center support vulnerable to manipulation - Namecheap : While better than GoDaddy, still vulnerable to social engineering and lacks enterprise-grade security controls - Consumer-focused services (Google Domains/Squarespace): Designed for personal use, not enterprise security - Resellers : Add another layer of complexity and potential attack surface","url":"/pages/infrastructure/dns-and-domain-registration#1-choosing-a-secure-registrar"},{"title":"DNS and Domain Registration Security › 2. Registrar-Level Protections","content":"Registry Lock (EPP Lock) Registry lock prevents unauthorized transfers at the registry level, not just the registrar. This is the strongest protection available for domain security. EPP Status Codes that protect your domain: - clientTransferProhibited : Prevents domain transfers to another registrar - clientUpdateProhibited : Prevents any DNS or contact information changes - clientDeleteProhibited : Prevents domain deletion - serverTransferProhibited : Registry-level transfer protection (stronger than client-level) - serverUpdateProhibited : Registry-level update protection - serverDeleteProhibited : Registry-level deletion protection How it protects you : Standard transfer locks only prevent transfers between registrars, but registry locks with full EPP protections prevent ALL unauthorized changes including DNS updates, contact modifications, and deletions. Server-level locks require manual verification with the registry operator (like Verisign for .com domains), making social engineering attacks at the registrar level completely ineffective. Setup : Contact enterprise registrars for registry-operator level locks. This typically requires additional fees and documentation but provides the highest level of security. #### Multi-Factor Authentication Multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security beyond just passwords, which are easily compromised through phishing or data breaches. Authentication options (in order of security): - Hardware Security Keys (YubiKey/FIDO2): Most secure option, immune to phishing - TOTP Applications (Google Authenticator, Authy): Minimum acceptable standard - Avoid SMS 2FA : Vulnerable to SIM swapping attacks #### Dedicated Security Contact Email Use a dedicated email address for domain security that's completely separate from your main domain and personal accounts. Why this matters : If your main domain is compromised, you need a way to receive security notifications and regain control. Using the same domain creates a circular dependency. As a best practice register a separate domain specifically for domain management (e.g., yourproject-domains.com or yourproject-security.com ) with a different registrar than your main domain. This ensures you maintain communication channels even if your primary domain is completely compromised. #### Access Control Best Practices Limit and monitor who has access to your domain registrar account, as each person with access represents a potential attack vector. Key practices : - Document all personnel with registrar access - Use role-based access where available - Implement approval workflows for critical changes - Regular access audits (quarterly minimum) #### WHOIS Privacy Protection WHOIS records contain personal information about domain owners that is publicly accessible by default, including names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses.

Sanctions violations: The DPRK is a sanctioned entity. No company can legally transfer funds to DPRK-related operations. 6. Contribution to the North Korean Military: DPRK IT worker salaries directly contribute to the Military Ministry of North Korea. The workers do not keep the salaries for themselves. 7. Supply-chain compromise: DPRK IT Workers may intentionally introduce vulnerabilities that impact down-stream projects that depend on your software / services (e.g. SafeWallet UI in the ByBit hack). 8. Reputational damage: To your brand and loss of trust of your users and customers. 9. Asset freeze / loss of access to financial services: your assets may be frozen or seized, and financial institutions (e.g. banks, exchanges) may terminate your access if you are suspected of funding sanctioned entities. 10. Criminal investigations: Law enforcement may investigate your involvement and impose fines or press criminal charges against your organization. ---","url":"/pages/insider-threats/README#overview-of-risks-to-your-organization"},{"title":"Case Studies › Introduction","content":"import { TagList, AttributionList, TagProvider, TagFilter, ContributeFooter } from '../../../components' # Case Studies Here are a few deviations from the usual DPRK IT Worker patterns. As mentioned a few times already, the goal is to always be open-minded about threat actor tactics. They are known to evolve and adapt while also pushing their methods further. The examples below are anonymized, but they are real cases we have encountered in the past: #### Story 1 Background: A GitHub profile created in 2013, with no flagged &quot;copied repositories&quot; (indicating original code), an active and verified Twitter account from 2012, and no history of nickname changes on any platform. The user claimed to be Japanese, which was reflected in his posts and 10+ years of digital activity. The nicknames were &quot;relevant&quot; to Web3/Blockchain (e.g., using a &quot;0x&quot; prefix or &quot;sol&quot; in the name). A Rust developer with experience in Solana was looking to get hired by a Solana project. Conclusion: This was a DPRK IT Worker, confirmed by independent sources who had also been &quot;spammed&quot; by the same actor. The most likely reason for avoiding most software flags was a &quot;stolen&quot; account. DPRK operatives managed to get their hands on the GitHub and Twitter handles of a Japanese citizen, which had been lying dormant without ANY activity for 10+ years. They then proceeded to build a history on these accounts for almost two years before starting to apply for jobs and messaging other developers. It's worth noting that no event history was present for this GitHub account, as the original owner had never used it after signing up. This allowed them to build a &quot;perfect&quot; dummy history with no event data present in the GitHub Archive. This absence of data, along with a significant gap in Twitter activity between 2013 and 2022, contributed to flagging this particular actor. #### Story 2 Background: An actor who had worked for three years at a popular security company. (An example of a perfect backstory for future employment.) The actor was usually delegated auxiliary tasks, which he completed diligently and on time. He was reluctant to accept promotions or on-site invitations, citing his own business as the reason. The company was fine with this, as he was an auxiliary worker. His GitHub profile was created in 2021 and had a single, yet consistent, name change. The actor used his GitHub account only for work at that company and did not maintain any social media profiles. There was no overly informative README/About page, no avatar, and he consistently used a single Gmail address. Conclusion: This was a DPRK IT Worker. By cross-referencing our existing database and performing an extremely deep analysis of commits from actors we suspected were connected to him, we finally found his old nickname associated with two commits to an already known -but old and inactive - account of a known DPRK IT Worker.

Who are DPRK IT Workers? 1. An insider threat refers to the risk posed by individuals within an organization who misuse their authorized access to compromise the organization's security. This misuse can involve malicious actions like data theft or sabotage, but also unintentional actions like negligence (e.g. ignoring security updates) or accidents (e.g. sending sensitive document to the wrong email address) leading to security breaches and/or data leaks. 2. DPRK IT workers are individuals from North Korea (the Democratic People's Republic of Korea) who engage in remote IT work for foreign companies, often using false identities. Their work, while often appearing legitimate, is a source of revenue for the North Korean regime, may be involved in malicious activities, and constitutes a serious violation of international sanctions to send payments to North Korea. &quot;DPRK IT Workers&quot; are synonymous with an &quot;insider threat.&quot; 3. Read: OFAC's North Korea Information Technology Workers Advisory 4. Read: Google's advisory on DPRK IT Workers #### Operational structure and short history of DPRK IT Workers 1. North Korean IT workers, operating both within the DPRK and abroad, are a significant source of revenue for the country's regime, particularly for its weapons programs. They engage in various IT roles (but are not limited to these roles!), often disguising their identity and location to secure freelance contracts and generate income that is remitted back to North Korea. These workers are primarily based in China and Russia, with some in other parts of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. North Koreans are also observed to run a network of 'facilitators' (or local accomplices) to help them cover their identities and facilitate remote employment. The facilitator lends his or hers digital and physical identity in exchange for compensation from the DPRK IT Workers. 2. Reports of North Korean IT workers operating internationally began to surface around the mid-2010s, with a growing awareness of their role in generating revenue for the regime. The number of DPRK IT workers increased, with a wider geographical spread and a diversification of their activities from the late-2010s to the present. 3.

Generating stable revenue for the North Korean regime through remote IT work. 2. Building support networks for North Korean IT-related operations (mules and money laundering). 3.

All of the strategies covered in the prior section, Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures , still apply but serve a more 'active' role to identify DPRK IT Workers during recruiting or within your organization. Here, we will discuss mitigation strategies that limit the effects of a DPRK IT Worker infiltration and what you should do after identifying a successful infiltration. #### Hardening your hiring processes 1. Apply all the steps from the sections Am I Interviewing a DPRK IT Worker? and Did I hire a DPRK IT Worker? . It's important to educate all of your non-DPRK employees on these points, especially people responsible for hiring, developer relations, talent hunting, and community management. 2. Introduce a culture of background checks. Do not take a prospective developer's claims at face value. Even the most basic OSINT check can often discover deep inconsistencies. Check GitHub commit history, check Twitter history, and Google the full name of the developer. 1. Is the work experience claimed in the CV reflected on GitHub? 2. Does the potential employee indicate any physical presence anywhere? 3. Is the potential employee writing non-AI-generated posts and replying to anything other than job offers on Twitter? 4. Did you find any name collisions after searching for the potential employee's name in Google? 5. Did you check the potential employee's nickname in Google? Maybe they have already appeared as a threat actor in a past report? 6. Remember the best discovery rule: You're looking for misrepresentations, mismatches, and obfuscation, not for North Koreans specifically. Tick your boxes on the first three and only then proceed to decide if you're potentially dealing with a North Korean. 3. Do not try to undercut developer market salaries. DPRK IT Workers will always accept low-ball offers without much hesitation. If you're looking for a cheap hire, you are at a higher chance of hiring a DPRK IT Worker. 4. ALWAYS perform your own due diligence on new remote employees. Do not settle for recommendations from third parties; they could be victims themselves. 5. You could ask about North Korea on call and observe the reaction. There's a so-called &quot;F**k Kim Jong Un&quot; test, where interviewer is asking to repeat the phrase and North Koreans are banned from saying it and they drop the call immediately. Obviously, it won't be effective for 'facilitators' but it will most likely be effective for North Koreans themselves. Do not rely on it as a panacea. 6. Regardless of our tips of not focusing on &quot;Asian man in his 20-30s&quot; that particular appearance is still the most common (If not cloaked under the generative AI).

They are North Korean individuals, often operating from abroad (primarily China and Russia), who use fraudulent identities to secure remote IT jobs. Their primary goal is to generate revenue for the North Korean regime, which may involve legitimate work but also opens the door to espionage, data theft, extortion, and future hacking activities. * How to Spot DPRK IT Workers During Hiring: * Focus on detecting fraud and misrepresentation , not stereotypes. Look for inconsistencies across their CV, digital profiles, and interview answers. * During video interviews, insist the camera is on. Watch for AI-generated faces, obscured or generic backgrounds, and an inability to answer small-talk questions related to their claimed location or nationality. * Scrutinize their GitHub profile for red flags like a recent account creation date with years of &quot;faked&quot; commit history, &quot;copied&quot; repositories from legitimate projects, spam-like contributions, or interactions with other suspicious accounts. * Check their social media (LinkedIn, Twitter) for a lack of personal photos, a history of job-begging posts, and no evidence of a physical presence at conferences or events. * Be wary of highly unorthodox identity combinations, such as an Asian individual living in one country while providing KYC documents from a completely different continent. * How to Verify an Existing Employee: * Watch for behavioral patterns like consistently avoiding in-person meetings with repeated excuses or work patterns that don't match their claimed time zone. * Audit workspace logs for suspicious IP addresses (VPNs, proxies, known sanctioned regions). * Be on high alert if an employee suddenly changes their name or GitHub handle, or deletes social media accounts, as this often happens after being discovered elsewhere. * Verify their claimed work history independently. Be cautious if they recommend other candidates, as they often leverage their position to bring in more DPRK operatives. * How to Harden Your Organization: * Implement a &quot;least privilege&quot; principle for access control. New and remote employees should not have admin rights, permission to publish packages, or be signers on multisig wallets. * Appoint a trusted, fully-vetted individual to review all code and actions from remote contributors before they are merged or deployed. * Perform your own due diligence on all remote hires. Do not rely solely on third-party recruiters or recommendations, as they can also be victims. * Avoid the temptation to hire based on the lowest salary offer, as DPRK IT workers often work at a significant discount. * What to Do After Discovering a DPRK IT Worker: * Do not fire them immediately.

The sections dedicated to answering the questions &quot;Am I interviewing a DPRK IT Worker?&quot; and &quot;Did I hire a DPRK IT Worker?&quot; are interchangeable and both provide strategy outlines for avoiding, discovering, and confirming DPRK-related insider threats. Your organization can use tips from these sections to identify a DPRK IT Worker before you hire them, as well as to identify them after you have made the mistake of hiring one. This section focuses on dealing with emergent situations to identify potential DPRK IT workers who are attempting to or already have infiltrated your organization. In the next section, ( Mitigating DPRK IT Workers ), we will discuss strategies to harden your organization to minimize both the impact and the chances of infiltration and how to deal with the fallout of hiring a DPRK IT Worker. #### How can DPRK IT Workers find a job in your company? 1. There is no single established channel through which a DPRK IT Worker can approach your company. Applying with an impressive CV and GitHub portfolio through a public channel (LinkedIn/Job Portal) is common; however, we have often observed alternative routes, such as: 1. Direct outreach to CEO/CTO. They are persistent until clearly denied the opportunity, and even then, the actor may change their identity and try again. 2. Initiating contact through open-source contributions. An actor will submit valid Pull Requests to your repositories and use this as a way to request a job interview. 3. Recommendation. A worker will come recommended by another DPRK IT Worker or by a company they previously infiltrated (where the company may or may not be aware the employee is a DPRK IT Worker). 4. Tech recruiters. Recruiters often prioritize evaluating skillsets over performing background checks. DPRK IT Workers can appear on their radar and be unwittingly pushed by a legitimate tech recruiter to your company. 5. Bounty/Hackathon participation. DPRK IT Workers look for ANY source of revenue, no matter how small or large. If your company runs free-for-all bounty systems, it's extremely likely that some of the contributors are DPRK IT Workers. 6. Hired through a &quot;dev shop.&quot; If you recruit your employees through an outsourcing agency, you need to ensure their vetting process is appropriate. The outsourcing agency itself can be a victim of DPRK IT Worker infiltration. 2. The bottom line is that there is no single &quot;safe&quot; remote recruitment channel. You should vet your potential employees independently and look beyond their skillset, which can often be impressive. We have observed DPRK IT Workers joining companies by utilizing all the channels mentioned above.

Check if your email has been in any breach on Have I Been Pwned and set up notifications for future breaches. Change passwords on the services where you may have been breached. 3. If you suspect a breach of your password, change it as soon as possible. 4. Use MFA whenever possible. It is a key measure in preventing account breaches. It is highly recommended to use a hardware token such as Yubikey to protect your accounts. If you use a mobile authenticator such as Authy to store your MFA tokens, ensure that you also set an encryption password to mitigate the risk of SIM swapping. Avoid using SMS for MFA unless there is no other option, as there are multiple cases where people have been SIM swapped and their accounts taken over. If SMS is the only option, it is still better than having no MFA enabled at all. It is recommended to not use the password manager/vault used for your passwords to store your MFA codes. 5.

For an added bonus, you might consider creating a new Google account under a fake name and purchasing Google Fi from there. This will ensure that an insider at T-Mobile won’t be able to find your phone number by name. #### Efani Efani is an MVNO using AT&amp;T’s and Verizon’s networks and is designed for high-risk individuals. Efani has negotiated agreements in which they are responsible for manually approving requests to modify subscriber accounts instead of allowing agents at AT&amp;T or Verizon to make those changes. Efani also masks your information before submitting it to the MNOs, making it harder for an insider to locate your account.","url":"/pages/opsec/old/digital-identity-access/sim-swapping#usa"},{"title":"SIM Swapping › Place a Note on Your Carrier Account","content":"If you can’t switch carriers or no secure carriers are available in your area, your next option is to mitigate the likelihood of a support agent being social engineered. Some carriers will offer this explicitly (for example, some sort of account lock that you can opt into). If there is no option, you may need to either call or go in-store and ask for a note to be placed on your account. Keep in mind that some support agents may not know about SIM swapping, and that’s not their fault. If this happens, you might need to politely ask to speak to a manager or just come back another day. Also, keep in mind that while you may be able to add an internal note to your account, there’s no guarantee that whatever support agent who is communicating with a scammer will actually read the note. The scammer may also be able to convince the agent that they’re desperately in need to regain access quickly, and to ignore the note entirely. As such, placing a note on your account is a nice additional measure but not nearly as effective as simply disabling SMS 2FA on your accounts. ---","url":"/pages/opsec/old/digital-identity-access/sim-swapping#place-a-note-on-your-carrier-account"},{"title":"Human-Centered Security › Introduction","content":"import { TagList, AttributionList, TagProvider, TagFilter, ContributeFooter } from '../../../../../components' # Human-Centered Security Security is not just about technology—it's about people.

While the employees didn't intend harm, they became unwitting insider threats after being manipulated. * Similarly, the 2022 Ronin Network hack ($625 million) began with social engineering of a Sky Mavis senior engineer. This employee became a compromised insider, giving attackers access to four validator nodes. Combined with a third-party validator, this allowed the massive cryptocurrency theft[^3]. This demonstrates how social engineering creates insider threats even when employees have no malicious intent. * The 2019 SIM-swapping attacks represent a more direct insider threat scenario. Mobile carrier employees were bribed or socially engineered to transfer victims' phone numbers to attacker-controlled SIMs. In Michael Terpin's case against AT&amp;T, an employee allegedly accepted payment to compromise his account, leading to $24 million in cryptocurrency theft[^4]. This represents both compromised insiders and potentially malicious insiders who knowingly participated in exchange for payment. These examples highlight the intersection of social engineering and insider threats, where external attackers manipulate employees to gain unauthorized access.

Upon returning, scan devices for malware and consider resetting high-risk devices. &gt; ❗ This is not, by any means, an extensive guide on this subject or expected to be followed at its core. Its intention is to guide and provide hints as to where to apply security. This will vary depending on case to case, or, in other words, the risks you expose yourself to, by specifically traveling. This guide is categorized into four sections: 1. Before traveling: All the things you could do before you depart, such as hardening some devices or making sure you have a backup of the data you’ll be traveling with, even letting know someone you’ll be calling in case of an emergency and how to identify you. This does not necessarily mean that if you’re reading this while traveling you cannot do anything from that list, only that it might be more challenging to execute depending on your context. 2. While traveling: All the things you have to pay attention to or take care of while on the move. Is it necessary to connect to that conference’s WiFi? Have you checked if there is a camera that might be recording your keystrokes? Leaving your computer unattended or just running whatever software your hackathon teammate asks you to download in order for your promising project to win. 3. Returning home: Not in the literal sense of it, but directed toward all the things you have to do after your travels. From updating your processes based on experience to wiping exposed devices before rejoining them to your networks. 4. Additional information for high-profile targets: If you are a high-profile target, you’ll evidently realize that some of these initial suggestions fall short within your threat model. This section provides a hint toward profiles like yours.","url":"/pages/opsec/travel/guide"},{"title":"Guide › Before traveling","content":"💡 Remove or securely store any data, devices, printed files, and documents you don’t absolutely need on the trip . The less sensitive information and fewer critical assets you carry, the lower the risk and impact if loss, theft, or inspection occurs. Minimize your digital and physical footprint by leaving backups and originals securely at home or in trusted locations, and encrypt what must travel with you. This principle applies to laptops, phones, hardware wallets, paper backups, and any portable storage media.","url":"/pages/opsec/travel/guide#before-traveling"},{"title":"Guide › **Perform a quick threat model**","content":"Even if you are already traveling, take 5 minutes to map out your risks. Identify what assets you're carrying (laptops, phones, hardware wallets, seed phrases, account access), who might target them (thieves, cybercriminals, border agents, etc.), and how attacks might happen (device theft, tampering, malware, coercion). For each threat, plan a mitigation. For example, if you're carrying a hardware wallet, a threat is pickpocketing – mitigation could be keeping it attached to yourself (just don't use ledger's necklace) and securing it with a secure PIN/passphrase (no patterns, not repeated across devices). This exercise keeps security measures proportionate to your situation.","url":"/pages/opsec/travel/guide#perform-a-quick-threat-model"},{"title":"Guide › **Secure devices with encryption & updates**","content":"Enable full-disk encryption on all devices (laptops, phones, tablets) to protect data if lost or stolen. Most modern OSes have this by default (e.g. BitLocker for Windows, FileVault for MacOS, LUKS for Linux,or Android/iOS encryption – just ensure a strong password/PIN is set). Use popular devices like iPhones and Pixels. Install the latest OS and app updates since these patch security vulnerabilities, you can install any of the mobile security applications there are, which adds a layer of security and also reminds you of important security updates. If you must bring high-risk confidential data, consider encrypting those files individually using tools like VeraCrypt.","url":"/pages/opsec/travel/guide#secure-devices-with-encryption-updates"},{"title":"Guide › **Back up and prepare for loss**","content":"Back up your devices before travel (and ensure cloud backups like iCloud/Google are up to date). This way, if a device is lost or confiscated, you won’t lose important information. Record device details (make, model, serial numbers, IMEI for phones) and keep that list separate – it will help in filing reports or remote-wipe commands. If your company uses Mobile Device Management (MDM) on phones or laptops, verify the device is enrolled and you know how to trigger a remote wipe or “lost mode.” Test “Find My” or equivalent device-finding services so you can use them if needed. Pack chargers and cables so you won’t need to borrow unknown ones (which could be malicious).","url":"/pages/opsec/travel/guide#back-up-and-prepare-for-loss"},{"title":"Guide › **Protect Accounts with 2FA redundancy**","content":"Plan for how you’ll access accounts that use two-factor authentication if your main device is unavailable. For authenticator apps (TOTP codes), print out backup codes for your important accounts and keep them securely in services like 1Password or NordPass. Alternatively, consider storing them elsewhere physically (not on your phone). If your 2FA is tied to a phone number (SMS or voice), disable SMS for 2FA . For technologies that are unfortunately dependent on phone numbers, use a separate line (not your personal one) from services like Google Voice, Burner App or SLYFONE. Transfer your number to an eSIM since they are harder to physically steal or swap than a physical SIM . You can also register a backup 2FA method (e.g. add a secondary phone or a backup hardware key to your accounts) in case of emergency. Ensure your password manager is accessible – many like 1Password have a Travel Mode that removes sensitive vaults from your device while you travel (you can restore them later). This limits exposure if your device is searched or seized .","url":"/pages/opsec/travel/guide#protect-accounts-with-2fa-redundancy"},{"title":"Guide › **Secure your wallets and keys**","content":"Hardware wallets (e.g. Ledger, Trezor): Update the firmware and test the device before you leave, don’t do this while traveling. Do NOT bring any written seed phrases under any circumstance – seed backups are unencrypted keys that are far easier to steal or copy than a hardware device. Leave seed backups in a secure place and travel only with your hardware wallet. Enable all security features on the device (set a strong PIN, and use a BIP39 passphrase for example, if supported) so that even if the device is stolen, the amount of required information to access your crypto, is high. Carry hardware wallets and security keys in your carry-on or under your sight , not in checked luggage, to avoid loss or tampering. Yubikeys and 2FA tokens: Bring them to protect logins (they’re the best MFA) and make sure they’re enabled on your critical accounts. Keep them on your person or in a separate bag from your laptop/phone so that a thief or snoop can’t easily steal both at once. If you have a spare hardware wallet or Yubikey , you might leave one at home as a backup in case the one you carry is lost. Add, when possible, an extra layer of security to the token, such as a PIN code.","url":"/pages/opsec/travel/guide#secure-your-wallets-and-keys"},{"title":"Guide › **Lock down phones**","content":"On your smartphone, take advantage of security settings before you travel. Set a strong passcode (not just a 4-digit PIN or pattern). Consider disabling Touch ID/Face ID if you might face situations where someone could force-unlock your device using your biometrics – in many jurisdictions, authorities can compel a fingerprint or face scan more easily than a memorized password . At a minimum, know how to quickly and temporarily disable biometrics ; for example, on an iPhone, holding the side button and a volume button will trigger an emergency mode that requires the passcode to unlock . On Android, use Lockdown mode if available (which only temporarily disables biometrics and is different from iOS Lockdown Mode). If you have an iPhone, enable Lockdown Mode (extreme protection on iOS) even if you are not at high risk or traveling to a high-threat region – but be aware it restricts many features , though totally worth it. Disabling or restricting USB debugging on Android and using iOS USB restricted mode helps prevent unauthorized physical USB access and reduces risks from malicious cables or compromised charging stations. If your phone is managed by work (MDM), inform your IT team of your travel so they can assist with any location-based security policies and ensure you have the latest security profile. Finally, consider using a dedicated eSIM/local SIM for travel data. This can protect your primary phone number (you can keep your main line on eSIM and turn it off, while using a local data eSIM for mobile internet) and avoids physical SIM issues. Configure additional phone protections: On iOS devices, disable Control Center and Notification Center access from the lock screen (Settings &gt; Face ID &amp; Passcode) to prevent thieves from seeing notifications or enabling Airplane Mode without unlocking. Disable USB accessory connections when locked to prevent unauthorized connections. For device recovery, ensure Find My iPhone is enabled with &quot;Send Last Location&quot; and &quot;Find Network&quot; options activated so tracking continues even if the device is powered off. On Android, similar protections can be configured: disable notifications on lock screen (Settings &gt; Notifications &gt; On lock screen &gt; Don't show notifications), and enable &quot;Find My Device&quot; with all location services. Pay special attention apps security : many financial apps default to PIN verification instead of biometrics, which means a thief who has your phone and knows your PIN could potentially access your financial accounts even if they can't bypass Face ID/Touch ID. Use unique PINs for banking apps that differ from your device PIN, or where possible, configure these apps to require biometric verification for every login.","url":"/pages/opsec/travel/guide#lock-down-phones"},{"title":"Guide › **Minimize digital footprint & social visibility**","content":"It's not just cyber threats – operational security matters. Avoid announcing your travel plans publicly on social media and be careful with real-time updates. Posts about being away from home can signal to criminals that you (and possibly valuable devices or even your house) are vulnerable. Consider sharing trip photos and crypto conference highlights after you return or only with trusted contacts. Ensure your social media privacy settings are tightened so strangers can't see your travel posts. When registering for events, use privacy-focused tools like iOS's Hide My Email or create burner emails through providers like ProtonMail. Avoid giving out personal details unnecessarily during registration—use minimal, generic info to reduce your digital footprint. Discretion is key: if possible, don't advertise that you work in crypto or carry cryptocurrency. For example, remove or cover any crypto stickers on laptops or bags , and avoid wearing company swag or Bitcoin/Ethereum logos while in transit. These can be neon signs attracting thieves or unwanted attention (&quot;I have valuable data or wallets!&quot;). If asked about your work or luggage by curious strangers, have a cover story (e.g. &quot;I work in finance/IT&quot;) rather than &quot;I manage a crypto fund&quot;. High-profile team members might travel under pseudonyms or at least not list their company on luggage tags to stay low-profile. Also, be wary that you might be traveling with someone with these characteristics, so don't give them away.","url":"/pages/opsec/travel/guide#minimize-digital-footprint-social-visibility"},{"title":"Guide › **Plan emergency and incident responses**","content":"Before departure, know what you'll do if something goes wrong. Have a fallback plan in case of device loss: who will you notify &amp; how (have safe words and beware of deepfakes or impersonations); how will you revoke access to sensitive accounts; and how will you continue working (e.g., a backup laptop or a colleague who can step in). If traveling to countries with strict tech or encryption laws (e.g., China, Russia, UAE), devices like VPNs, encrypted messaging apps (Signal, or Telegram with Secret Chats only), hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor), Yubikeys, or encryption software (VeraCrypt, BitLocker) may be flagged by border authorities. Research local laws beforehand. Consider carrying a travel letter from your organization explaining the professional need for these tools, or use sanitized loaner devices to avoid issues at border controls. Share your itinerary and contact information with a trusted peer so they can assist or monitor for any issues. Finally, schedule critical work (especially high-value transactions) for before or after your trip if possible, so you’re not forced to do ultra-sensitive actions on the road. Criminals usually play with the “time-sensitive factor,” trying to trick you into doing something quick and urgent, by committing something reckless.","url":"/pages/opsec/travel/guide#plan-emergency-and-incident-responses"},{"title":"Guide › **Network safety – avoid untrusted Wi-Fi & Bluetooth**","content":"Treat every network as potentially hostile . Whenever possible, use a cellular connection or a personal hotspot instead of public Wi-Fi – your mobile data is encrypted and safer than an open café or hotel network. If you must use public Wi-Fi (hotel, airport, conference), verify the network name with staff and disable auto-connect features so your devices don't join networks without prompting you. Turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on your phone and laptop when you're not using them; this reduces the risk of unsolicited connections or Bluetooth-based attacks. Also, disable any device-to-device sharing like AirDrop or Nearby Share to prevent strangers from sending you files . Use a trustworthy VPN for an extra layer of encryption for your internet traffic, although in most cases by using an updated device, safe hardcoded DNS records, and ensuring SSL while browsing (enforce HTTPS-only-modes or adding “http://*” to your uBlock list, might be enough. A reputable, non-logging VPN (or your company’s VPN) helps protect against snooping on public networks, especially if you’re handling highly sensitive work and using several communication channels. Using a personal portable router combined with a trusted VPN adds a strong layer of security when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks. This setup creates a private, encrypted tunnel between your devices and the internet, minimizing exposure to malicious actors on shared networks. Whenever possible, prefer mobile data over Wi-Fi, as cellular networks provide better encryption and isolation by default. If you must use Wi-Fi, disable automatic connections and ensure you connect only to verified, trusted networks to reduce risk.","url":"/pages/opsec/travel/guide#network-safety-avoid-untrusted-wi-fi-bluetooth"},{"title":"Guide › **Device handling – keep them close and protected**","content":"Never leave your devices (laptops, phones, hardware wallets) unattended or unsecured in public. Keep them on your person or within sight whenever possible. In a conference or cafe, use a cable lock for your laptop if you must step away briefly, take it with you or get someone you trust to watch it over for you. In hotels/Airbnbs, use the room safe for small devices when you're out, or consider a portable travel safe/bag you can lock to a fixed object. A portable door lock or door jammer for your room can add an extra barrier against intruders (useful in rentals without chain locks). This simple gadget prevents anyone (even with a key) from opening your door while you're inside, giving you peace of mind at night. When out and about, be mindful of pickpockets – use bags that zip and consider a subtle anti-theft backpack for expensive gadgets or important assets. For hardware wallets or Yubikeys, a good practice is to separate them from the device they authenticate: e.g. don't carry your Yubikey on the same keychain as your laptop bag key; keep it hidden on you. And, of course, keep devices powered off or locked when not in use – enable short auto-lock timeouts on your phone/laptop so they aren't unlocked if snatched .","url":"/pages/opsec/travel/guide#device-handling-keep-them-close-and-protected"},{"title":"Guide › **Beware of public USB charging**","content":"Avoid plug-and-play charging stations at airports or malls. The risk of “ juice jacking ” is that a malicious charging kiosk or cable can inject malware or siphon data when you connect via USB. Stick to using your own charger plugged into a power outlet, or use a USB data blocker (a little adapter that only passes power, not data). Similarly, do not plug unknown USB drives into your laptop – if someone hands you a free USB stick at an event, assume it could be a trap. USBGuard software (for Linux) or equivalent can be used to restrict USB device access on your computer, allowing only whitelisted devices. This tool can prevent an unknown USB from automatically tampering with your system by requiring authorization for new devices. At a minimum, disable any “USB autorun” features and consider locking down ports if your OS allows.","url":"/pages/opsec/travel/guide#beware-of-public-usb-charging"},{"title":"Guide › **Screen privacy and social engineering**","content":"Practice situational awareness when working in public spaces. Shoulder surfing is a real threat – someone nearby could be watching you enter passwords or PIN codes. Use a privacy screen filter on your laptop or phone to narrow the viewing angle. This makes it much harder for anyone not directly in front of your screen to read it. Sit with your back to a wall when possible, and shield the keypad with your body or hand when typing sensitive info. In crowded conferences or airports, be cautious if someone you don't know strikes up conversation — might be trying to distract you or talk about crypto; scammers might engage you to glean info or even attempt to get you to unlock your device. Don't log in to critical accounts in front of others – you never know who's looking. Also be mindful of phishing attempts : traveling users are prime targets for fake &quot;urgent&quot; emails or messages. Double-check any unusual prompts before entering credentials, especially if you're on untrusted Wi-Fi (use your VPN and look for HTTPS).","url":"/pages/opsec/travel/guide#screen-privacy-and-social-engineering"},{"title":"Guide › **Maintain OpSec in public**","content":"While traveling, blend in and stay discreet . Refrain from discussing sensitive matters in public areas where eavesdropping is possible, or directly sharing things like where you are staying to people you don't know. Even hotel lobbies or rideshares might not be secure for private discussions. When meeting people, don't give your phone to others to type down their socials, and remember to disable default options like Telegram's sharing phone number when adding a contact. Remember that hidden cameras or microphones could exist in unfamiliar environments. It's rare but not unheard of, especially in Airbnbs or rented spaces – malicious hosts have hidden cameras in items like smoke detectors, clock radios, or USB chargers . Give your accommodations a scan: look for odd or extra devices plugged in (especially facing beds or desks) and cover or unplug them if suspicious. You can also play ambient noise (or use a noise generator app) during confidential conversations to thwart any listening devices. Keep a low profile : as mentioned, don't flaunt crypto wealth or gear. For example, if attending a blockchain conference, consider using an alias on your name badge that doesn't explicitly say your company or title, and don't display that badge outside the venue. When moving around, secure your laptop in a nondescript sleeve or bag (instead of one with a well-known conference brand). The goal is to avoid drawing the attention of both petty thieves and more organized attackers by limiting the signals that you're a high-value crypto target. Don't fall into security by obscurity. Don't assume that by going &quot;stealth&quot;, you cannot be the victim of an attack. These section's suggestions don't replace the rest.","url":"/pages/opsec/travel/guide#maintain-opsec-in-public"},{"title":"Guide › **Traveling with high-value crypto or duties**","content":"If you must make crypto transactions or access sensitive systems while on the road, do so with caution. Use trusted hardware and networks: e.g. if you need to send a transaction, use your hardware wallet on your own laptop (never a shared computer), on a secured connection. Be aware of surveillance at events – attackers have been known to watch for people handling sensitive info. If you need to access a seed or enter a recovery phrase, do it in a private, secure setting (never over public Wi-Fi or in view of anyone, including cameras). Consider that everyone knows you own crypto at a crypto event , so your threat profile is elevated . Adjust your security: for instance, enable a passphrase or a pin on any single-signature wallet you carry so that even if someone obtains your hardware wallet, they can’t access funds without that passphrase. For large amounts, rely on multi-sig – you might carry one key on you and leave another key(s) with trusted parties so no single person has all signing power while traveling. In short, treat any on-trip crypto operations with more care than you would in the office.","url":"/pages/opsec/travel/guide#traveling-with-high-value-crypto-or-duties"},{"title":"Guide › While presenting or doing public appearances","content":"One often overlooked risk is the exposure caused by presenting or hosting technical workshops in public. Without properly hardening or isolating your computer before setting up, you may unintentionally expose network services to hostile environments or reveal sensitive information on-screen. Always prepare a clean, minimal environment and verify no confidential data or open ports are accessible before connecting to unfamiliar networks or projecting your screen.","url":"/pages/opsec/travel/guide#while-presenting-or-doing-public-appearances"},{"title":"Guide › **Physical safety and common sense**","content":"Operational security also has a physical aspect. Trust your instincts and normal travel safety rules: stick to well-lit and populated areas if carrying devices at night, don’t let strangers “shoulder surf” your ATM or credit card PIN (check for skimmers, fake interfaces), and keep your travel documents secure since identity theft can be as damaging as device theft. Use hotel lockers at conferences if provided (for example, some events offer secure charging lockers – use them rather than leaving devices out only). Beware of the classic “evil maid” scenario in hotels (where someone might tamper with your laptop in your room): using tamper-evident tape or seals on your laptop case can help detect this, though it’s mostly a concern for high-risk targets. If you have tamper-evident stickers or tamper-evident bags, you can seal your device in them overnight – any attempt to open or remove the device will leave a visible trace. While not foolproof against a determined adversary, it raises the bar and can deter casual snooping. Petty thieves may look beyond obvious valuables. Simply locking items in a dorm safe or hiding them at home might deter casual theft, but savvy criminals often search inside books, behind electrical outlets, or within patterns on walls or furniture to find hidden stashes. Consider unconventional hiding spots and avoid predictable storage methods. Layer your physical security measures with tamper-evident seals or discreet decoy containers to raise the effort required for unauthorized access. Above all, maintain an alert posture : be aware of who’s around when you’re working, and if something feels off (like someone persistently hovering or a device acting strangely), don’t ignore it. You can always relocate, power down your device, or otherwise cut off exposure at the first sign of trouble.","url":"/pages/opsec/travel/guide#physical-safety-and-common-sense"},{"title":"Guide › **Secure your accounts and passwords**","content":"Once you're back, if you suspect that any account credentials you used while abroad might have been exposed (especially if you had to log in over a hotel or conference Wi-Fi), address the issue. Change the passwords for any accounts you accessed unsafely during the trip – but if you don't feel is necessary, sometimes you pose a greater risk at doing so. Do this from a trusted device/network (ideally wait till you're on your home or office network, not the airport Wi-Fi). Use this opportunity to upgrade weak passwords and ensure 2FA is still working on those accounts. Check your email filters and crypto account settings for any unauthorized changes (attackers sometimes add forwarding rules or new withdrawal addresses if they did get access). Essentially, rotate secrets that may have been used under less-secure conditions.","url":"/pages/opsec/travel/guide#secure-your-accounts-and-passwords"},{"title":"Guide › **Inspect and clean your devices**","content":"After traveling, give your devices a thorough once-over. Run a reputable anti-malware scan on laptops and phones. Look for any unusual apps, processes, or device behavior (for example, unusual battery drain could indicate malware). If you were in a high-risk environment or your device was out of your control at any point, consider wiping the device and restoring it from your pre-trip backup (or factory-resetting a phone) to ensure it's clean . This is especially recommended for &quot;burner&quot; devices used on the trip – you can safely restore your data onto your main device and decommission the travel device. For hardware wallets, verify they weren't tampered with: check the device seals if any, and when you connect, confirm the firmware is still legitimate (if the manufacturer provides verification software). If you have any suspicion that a device (or hardware wallet) was compromised, do not continue using it for sensitive transactions . Transfer crypto assets to new wallets (using your seed backups in a new device if necessary) once you're on a secure network and device. It's also a good idea to disable or remove any travel-specific eSIMs or accounts you used on the trip – for example, remove that foreign cellular plan from your phone if you no longer need it, and uninstall any travel or conference apps that are no longer required.","url":"/pages/opsec/travel/guide#inspect-and-clean-your-devices"},{"title":"Guide › **Post-travel review**","content":"Now that you're home, reflect on the trip and note any security incidents or close calls. If any device was lost, stolen, or even taken out of your sight and potentially tampered (like held by airport security for a long inspection), inform your organization's IT or security team immediately. They may assist with forensic checks or account monitoring. Also inform colleagues if any work data might have been exposed so they can be vigilant. This is not about blame – it's about mitigating any damage early. Re-enable any data or accounts you put in &quot;travel mode.&quot; For instance, if you used 1Password Travel Mode to hide vaults, log in and turn those vaults back on. If you created throwaway emails or burner chat accounts for the trip, decide if you'll deactivate them now. Update your threat model based on your experience: did any new threats emerge, or did some precautions prove unnecessary? Use that to improve future travel prep. Finally, share key lessons with your team. Sharing what you've learned from each trip and tweaking your security practices contributes to a stronger security culture for everyone!","url":"/pages/opsec/travel/guide#post-travel-review"},{"title":"Guide › Additional precautions for high-risk travelers","content":"This section is for Web3 professionals who have elevated privileges or profiles – for example, access to multisig treasury keys, leadership roles, or possession of sensitive organizational secrets. These users may be targeted more deliberately by criminals or even nation-states. In addition to all the precautions above, high-risk travelers should take further steps: For high-profile or recognizable individuals, keeping a low profile is essential. Beyond avoiding branded merchandise, a simple yet effective tactic is wearing a COVID N95 mask or similar face covering. It's socially accepted, draws no attention, and helps protect your identity — making it harder for adversaries to target or track you during public events.","url":"/pages/opsec/travel/guide#additional-precautions-for-high-risk-travelers"},{"title":"Guide › **Use loaner or \"burner\" devices**","content":"If feasible, travel with clean devices that don't contain sensitive data . Leave your primary laptop/phone at a protected location (assuming you also have security in place as well), and bring a wiped, minimal laptop or a cheap travel phone with only the basics. Log into what you absolutely need (through secure channels) and nothing more. Treat these devices as expendable – assume they will be compromised and plan to wipe them afterward. For example, a senior developer might bring a laptop with no source code on it and use a VPN or VDI (virtual desktop) to access company systems when necessary, leaving no data on the local disk. A hardware wallet keyholder might carry a secondary hardware wallet with lower privileges (or a single key to a multisig instead of full access). Keep your primary keys secured in a location that is not accompanying you. Remember, a nearly empty device can raise suspicion at some borders, so don't make it obvious – load some innocuous data (music, generic files) so it looks used, but nothing that would be harmful if inspected.","url":"/pages/opsec/travel/guide#use-loaner-or-burner-devices"},{"title":"Guide › **Plan for customs and border checks**","content":"High-risk individuals may face increased scrutiny or device searches at borders due to the sensitive nature of their data or their roles (e.g., journalists). Before crossing borders , purge or secure sensitive information. Turn off devices before landing (some experts even recommend encrypting and then powering down devices – a powered-off device with strong encryption is extremely hard to access ). Disable cloud auto-sync of sensitive data; you don’t want customs inadvertently accessing company cloud drives if they inspect your laptop. If asked to unlock devices, having them powered off gives you an opportunity to state that it’s encrypted and requires a passphrase (which you should have memorized, not written down). It’s wise for high-risk travelers to disable biometrics entirely before travel – use PIN/password only, as mentioned – so you cannot be compelled or tricked via fingerprint/face. Know your legal rights in the countries you transit; in some places you can refuse to unlock (though it may mean the device is held or you are denied entry), while in others you might face penalties. This is a personal risk decision – but the best case is to carry nothing truly incriminating or irreplaceable across a checkpoint. For ultra-sensitive data, use secure communication channels to retrieve it at destination rather than carrying it. For instance, an executive could store confidential files in a secure cloud drive they access over VPN once abroad, rather than carrying them on a laptop.","url":"/pages/opsec/travel/guide#plan-for-customs-and-border-checks"},{"title":"Guide › **Enhanced device protections**","content":"High-risk users should layer additional defenses. Lockdown Mode (on iOS) or Android’s equivalent secure modes should be enabled if there’s any chance of targeted spyware (these modes disable exploit-prone services and attachments). Use messaging apps with end-to-end encryption and disappearing messages (NOT Telegram, Signal is a good example) for any sensitive communications – assume that standard SMS or emails could be monitored. Consider using a Faraday bag for phones when not in use, if you suspect active tracking or exploitation (this prevents any signals in or out, though use sparingly as it also blocks your calls). If you leave a device in your hotel, you can put it in a tamper-evident bag and seal it, or at least take measures like noting the exact placement or taking a photo, so you can detect if it was disturbed. Some high-risk individuals even weigh their devices before and after travel to detect the addition of hardware implants (a change in weight could indicate something like a chip added) – this is an extreme step, but shows the level of caution possible. At the very least, physically inspect your devices for new scratches, screws that look tampered with, or unexpected behavior.","url":"/pages/opsec/travel/guide#enhanced-device-protections"},{"title":"Guide › **Protect crypto keys with multi-party controls**","content":"If you have access to significant crypto funds (exchanges, DAO treasury, etc.), implement policies that prevent a single point of failure while you’re traveling. For example, if you’re one of N-of-M multisig signers, consider temporarily requiring an extra signer for transactions while you’re away (so if normally 2-of-3 can move funds, bump it to 3-of-3 or add a 4th backup signer) so that a compromised key or coerced action cannot alone execute a transfer. If you hold hardware keys, keep them geographically split – e.g. bring one key device with you, leave the backup key in a safe place at home, and perhaps give a third key to a colleague, so that even a forced disclosure cannot result in an immediate loss of funds without collaboration. Use duress codes if your hardware supports it (some wallets allow a secondary PIN that opens a decoy account with minimal funds, the same can also be made with encryption volumes). In general, assume a determined adversary could target you specifically for your role: use confidential communication to stay in touch with your team (so they know you’re safe daily), and establish a code word or protocol for emergencies. High-risk travelers might also arrange a “check-in” schedule with their security team or colleagues – if you don’t check in by a certain time, they can take pre-agreed actions (like disabling your accounts or alerting authorities). This kind of planning is an extra safety net when the stakes are especially high.","url":"/pages/opsec/travel/guide#protect-crypto-keys-with-multi-party-controls"},{"title":"Guide › **Post-trip device rebuilding**","content":"For highly targeted individuals, the safest course after returning is to treat every device as compromised and rebuild it, especially before reaching your safe zone (home, work office). This involves wiping devices to factory settings, flashing firmware if necessary, and restoring data from known-good backups made before the trip. Consider using read-only operating systems or booting from trusted live media during travel to reduce risk exposure. Before your trip, you can create a cloned disk image of a clean system state, so after traveling you can restore your device to that exact low-level copy — starting fresh with a known secure baseline. This approach helps eliminate stealthy malware or spyware that may have been implanted. Additionally, review system logs if available (security apps or MDM solutions often report unusual access or configuration changes during your absence). As always, report any suspicious incidents promptly. High-risk roles may require a debrief with your security officer — be transparent about any odd encounters or possible security lapses to mitigate threats that could have followed you home. -- Part of the contents were inspired and based on some of the following articles. - CISA Cybersecurity While Traveling – official tips on device updates, Wi-Fi safety, and physical device security | cisa.gov cisa.gov . - Cornell University IT Security – international travel security checklist (device encryption, using loaner devices, minimizing data) | it.cornell.edu | it.cornell.edu . - Cypherock Blog – &quot;Safe Vacation Tips while Traveling with Crypto&quot; (advice on MFA keys, avoiding public Wi-Fi and chargers, not carrying seed phrases) | cypherock.com | cypherock.com . - Schneier on Security (comments) – community OPSEC suggestions for border crossings (burner phones, no biometrics, 1Password Travel Mode) | schneier.com . - The MacGuys – Apple device travel tips (Lockdown Mode, separate eSIM for travel, disabling Face ID in emergencies) | themacguys.com | themacguys.com . - Unchained Capital – &quot;7 Tips for Traveling with Bitcoin Keys&quot; (don't advertise crypto holdings, leave seed backups at home, use passphrases/multisig for travel) | unchained.com | unchained.com . - BlackCloak – Dangers of oversharing travel on social media (real-time posts can invite burglaries or attacks) | blackcloak.io . - Trio Security Blog – Shoulder surfing and visual hacking (use privacy screens and be mindful of surroundings) | trio.so . - Washington Post – Portable door locks for travelers (added security in accommodations) | travelandleisure.com and finding hidden cameras in rentals | washingtonpost.com . - GitHub USBGuard – tool to enforce USB device policies on laptops (helps block malicious USB devices) | github.com . ---","url":"/pages/opsec/travel/guide#post-trip-device-rebuilding"},{"title":"Tldr › Introduction","content":"import { TagList, AttributionList, TagProvider, TagFilter, ContributeFooter } from '../../../../components' # Personal security travel guide — concise version &gt; 🔑 Key Takeaway: Protect your digital assets while traveling through minimizing sensitive data, using encrypted devices, avoiding public networks, securing hardware wallets, maintaining physical control of devices, being cautious with USB connections, practicing social discretion, and sanitizing devices upon return.","url":"/pages/opsec/travel/tldr"},{"title":"Tldr › Before traveling","content":"Remove or securely store any data, devices, or documents not essential for the trip.

An active exploit is one that’s already in progress or imminent - for example, a malicious transaction sitting in the mempool or a vulnerability that's already being exploited. Safe Harbor only applies when immediate action is required to prevent or stop fund loss. It does not apply to situations where there is no imminent threat and where responsible disclosure can prevent fund loss. How is it different than a Bug Bounty? Bug bounties reward whitehats for responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities before they’re exploited. Safe Harbor kicks in after an exploit is underway - when there’s no time for disclosure, and whitehats need legal cover to intervene and recover funds in real time. What are the risks? There is little to no risk. The status quo is the protocol is hacked and the hacker gets 100% of funds. But with Safe Harbor, we unlock the upside of whitehats stepping in and rescuing funds. So the worst case scenario is the status quo, while the best case scenario is all funds are rescued by the protocol. Whitehats only receive protection if they follow every requirement. If no exploit happens, nothing changes. If they do not follow Safe Harbor, they’re a blackhat Can DAOs adopt it? Yes. Safe Harbor was built with DAOs in mind. No legal entity is required - just a governance vote and public on-chain registration. Many protocols who have adopted are DAOs (ex: Uniswap, Balancer, Zksync) Can Non-DAOs adopt it? Yes. Centralized teams and foundations can also adopt Safe Harbor by publishing their scope and adoption terms. No DAO is required. Many protocols who have adopted are centralized teams (Pendle, Polymarket) Who is the agreement with? The Safe Harbor agreement is structured as a public unilateral offer - a legally binding offer made by your protocol to any whitehat who acts under the published terms. There’s no need to know or pre-approve the individual. If a whitehat follows your rules (e.g. intervenes during an active exploit, returns funds to the recovery address, meets any KYC requirements), the agreement becomes binding. No signatures or formal negotiation required. Do we need to sign a legal contract (like DocuSign)? Nope. Safe Harbor uses on-chain registration and public adoption details - no signatures or lawyers required. If you’re a DAO, a governance vote is enough. What if a blackhat initiates a hack with one account, then “whitehats” it with another account to get the bounty? They’re not covered. Safe Harbor protections only apply to whitehats who are fully independent from the original exploit. If someone initiates a hack and then tries to “rescue” the funds with another address, they’re still considered a blackhat - no bounty, no legal protection, and fully liable . To reduce this risk even further, we recommend protocols set their Safe Harbor bounty cap at or below their existing bug bounty.

It does so by providing a legal framework that outlines what whitehats can and can't do, how they ought to operate, and protects abiding whitehats in the event of legal action taken by the protocol. In addition to the legal protections, Safe Harbor also helps whitehats by giving them the following information: 1. What assets are owned by a protocol 2. What is the protocol's ( asset recovery address ) {/ TODO: link not found (./key-terms.md#asset-recovery-address) /} 3.

This includes transferring rescued funds to the protocol's &quot;Asset Recovery Address&quot; and promptly notifying the protocol of the fund recovery.

Instead of being controlled directly by a single private key, the account's logic is defined by its code. This is achieved through ERC-4337 , a standard that enables AA without requiring changes to the core Ethereum protocol. It introduces a higher-level pseudo-transaction system with several key components: * Smart Contract Account : The user's wallet itself is a smart contract, containing custom logic for validating transactions. * UserOperation : A data structure that bundles the user's intent, calldata, and signature. This object is sent to a dedicated, alternative mempool. * Bundlers : Specialized nodes that package multiple UserOperation objects from the mempool into a single transaction and submit it to the EntryPoint contract. * EntryPoint : A singleton smart contract that acts as the central orchestrator. It verifies and executes the bundled UserOperations , ensuring that accounts and paymasters have sufficient funds to pay for gas. * Paymasters : Optional smart contracts that can sponsor gas fees on behalf of the user, enabling gasless transactions for the end-user or allowing fees to be paid in ERC-20 tokens.","url":"/pages/wallet-security/account-abstraction#core-concept-erc-4337"},{"title":"Account Abstraction › Key Benefits & Features","content":"Enhanced Security : * Social Recovery : Mitigate the risk of losing a primary key by designating trusted &quot;guardians&quot; (other accounts or devices) who can collectively approve an account recovery. * Customizable Policies : Implement robust security rules directly into the wallet, such as daily spending limits, whitelisting trusted contracts, or requiring multisig confirmation for transactions over a certain value. * Improved User Experience : * Gasless Transactions : Enjoy a smoother experience where dApps can sponsor gas fees, or pay for transactions using ERC-20 tokens instead of needing the chain's native asset (e.g., ETH). * Simplified Interactions : Perform complex, multi-step actions (like approve and swap ) in a single, atomic transaction, reducing clicks and potential points of failure.","url":"/pages/wallet-security/account-abstraction#key-benefits-features"},{"title":"Account Abstraction › Security Considerations & Best Practices","content":"Smart Contract Risk : The security of an AA wallet is entirely dependent on the quality and security of its underlying smart contract code. Bugs or vulnerabilities in the account's implementation can lead to a total loss of funds. Thorough audits of the account logic are non-negotiable. * Guardian Selection and Security : The strength of the social recovery model depends on the security and independence of the guardians. They should be diverse and not susceptible to a single common threat. * EntryPoint Centralization : The EntryPoint contract is a central trust point for the entire ERC-4337 ecosystem. A vulnerability in the official EntryPoint could have widespread consequences. Use only the canonical, heavily audited EntryPoint contract. * Paymaster and Factory Security : Malicious or poorly coded Paymasters and Factories can introduce DoS vectors or other risks. The ERC-4337 standard includes a reputation system and staking mechanisms to throttle or ban misbehaving entities, but users should only interact with trusted and audited Paymasters. * Gas Overhead : The added logic in a smart contract account means that transactions can be more expensive than those from a standard EOA. This trade-off between features and cost should be considered, though it can be offset by gas sponsorship. * Key Revocation : If the primary signing key is compromised, the recovery process allows you to swap it out for a new one without having to move all assets to a new wallet address. * Advanced Guardian Setups : For enhanced security, guardian roles can be implemented using Multi-Party Computation (MPC) . In an MPC-based recovery, guardians hold cryptographic shares that are used collectively to authorize a recovery action. This method allows guardians to produce a valid signature through a distributed computation using their individual shares, without ever reconstructing a single master key on any device. ---","url":"/pages/wallet-security/account-abstraction#security-considerations-best-practices"},{"title":"Cold Vs Hot Wallet › Introduction","content":"import { TagList, AttributionList, TagProvider, TagFilter, ContributeFooter } from '../../../components' # Cold vs. Hot Wallets The primary distinction between wallet types is their connectivity to the internet.

Avoid N-of-N schemes, as the loss of a single key would result in a permanent loss of access to all funds. * Strategic Signer Distribution: The security of a multisig depends entirely on the operational security (OpSec) of its individual signer keys. Storing multiple signer keys on the same device or in the same physical location negates the security benefits. Effective distribution strategies include: * Using different hardware wallet models and manufacturers. * Maintaining geographical separation for devices holding signer keys. * Assigning signer keys to different trusted individuals within an organization. * Using diverse client software to interact with the multisig to mitigate single-point-of-failure risks from a software vulnerability. * Practice on Testnet: Before deploying on mainnet, thoroughly practice wallet creation, transaction signing, and owner management on a test network. * Timelocks: Enforce a mandatory delay between the approval of a transaction and its execution. This provides a critical window for the community or team to detect and react to malicious proposals. * Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implement modules that grant specific, limited permissions to certain addresses (e.g., a &quot;pauser&quot; or &quot;executor&quot; role) without making them full owners, adhering to the principle of least privilege. * Disaster Recovery Plan: Establish a clear, documented process for what to do when a signer is compromised, the multi-signature UI is down, or other emergencies arise.

Using a primary work laptop significantly increases the risk of malware interference. * Independent Transaction Verification: Before signing, always verify the raw transaction data (target address, function call, parameters) to ensure it matches the intended operation. * Out-of-Band Verification for Admin Changes: Any critical administrative action, such as adding or replacing a signer, must be verified through multiple, independent communication channels (e.g., a video call and a signed message) to prevent social engineering attacks. * Active Monitoring: Implement monitoring and alerting systems to be immediately notified of any on-chain activity related to the multisig, including proposed transactions, new signatures, and owner changes (e.g., using tools like Safe Watcher ). * Documented Procedures: Maintain clear, secure, and accessible documentation for all multisig procedures, including transaction creation, signing, and emergency recovery plans.","url":"/pages/wallet-security/secure-multisig-best-practices#operational-best-practices"},{"title":"Secure Multisig Best Practices › Acknowledgements","content":"Some ideas were borrowed from the EF's multisig SOP notes and Manifold Finance multisig best practices . ---","url":"/pages/wallet-security/secure-multisig-best-practices#acknowledgements"},{"title":"Secure Multisig Signing Process › Introduction","content":"import { TagList, AttributionList, TagProvider, TagFilter, ContributeFooter } from '../../../components' # Verifying Multisig Transactions The security of a multisig wallet relies on each signer independently verifying what they are signing.

Decode and Compare : Use a calldata decoder (e.g., calldata.swiss-knife.xyz ) to parse the data shown on your hardware wallet. 4. Confirm Parameters : Carefully check the decoded parameters within the execTransaction call, especially the internal destination address ( to ), value , and data payload. Ensure they match the original, intended transaction. 5.

This opcode gives another contract full control over your wallet's context and storage. - Transaction Simulation : Before signing, use a simulator like Tenderly or Alchemy to preview the transaction's outcome. This helps confirm that it will not revert and will result in the expected state changes. - Hardware Wallet Standard : All multisig signers should use hardware wallets to protect their keys from online threats. Data shown in a browser extension wallet should be treated with the same skepticism as data in the web UI. - Alternative Frontends : To further reduce reliance on a single public UI, consider using an alternative or self-hosted multisig interface. ---","url":"/pages/wallet-security/secure-multisig-signing-process#operational-best-practices"},{"title":"Signing Schemes › Introduction","content":"Signing Schemes","url":"/pages/wallet-security/signing-schemes"},{"title":"Signing Verification › Introduction","content":"import { TagList, AttributionList, TagProvider, TagFilter, ContributeFooter } from '../../../components' # Signing &amp; Verification This section provides a guide to transaction verification, from basic EOA interactions to advanced multisig operations.

The raw transaction data is the ground truth of what you are authorizing. Always use independent tools to confirm that what you see is what you sign. - Simulate Before Signing : Before approving any non-trivial transaction, use a simulation tool. These tools act as a &quot;sandbox,&quot; showing you the human-readable outcome before you commit, protecting you from unexpected results and malicious contracts. - The Hardware Wallet is the Source of Truth : Your hardware wallet's trusted display is your last line of defense against UI spoofing. If the information on your computer screen does not perfectly match what is on your hardware device, reject the transaction immediately. - Demand Clear Signing : Prioritize hardware and software that can decode and display a transaction's intent in a human-readable format.
